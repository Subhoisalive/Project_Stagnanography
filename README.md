# 🖼️ Modern Image Steganography Tool

A Python-based **Image Steganography Tool** with a **modern Tkinter GUI** and **animated background**, developed by **Suvhankar Dutta**.  

This tool allows you to **hide any file inside an image (PNG/JPG/JPEG)** and later **extract it back** securely.  
It uses **SHA-256 hashing** to ensure data integrity and prevent corrupted extraction.
